        <p>Alex and Claire visited the local weather station where Dr. Hayes, a meteorologist, showed them a map divided into a Cartesian plane. The weather station was the origin. They plotted locations for the rain gauge, wind speed monitor, temperature sensor, and humidity sensor. Their task was to analyse these points and understand how weather data is collected and used for forecasting.

    After analysing the map and plotting the points for the rain gauge, wind speed monitor, temperature sensor, and humidity sensor, Alex and Claire connected the dots to identify various geometric shapes. They determined the coordinates of each sensor and located them within their respective quadrants. Their investigation provided a deeper understanding of how weather data is collected and visualised for accurate forecasting.
